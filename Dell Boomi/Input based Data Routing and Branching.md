# Input based Data Routing and Branching
Using Data Process and Process Router

## Data Process Shape
WHen you want to branch process to different shapes
![daba8e05.png](:storage\735a14b4-e9f3-4d93-80e3-ae22104379ee\daba8e05.png)

It has three elements
* **Process Type**
![0aa95bad.png](:storage\735a14b4-e9f3-4d93-80e3-ae22104379ee\0aa95bad.png)

* **Profile Type** 
Flat file/json/xml/database


## Process Route
To do actually routing of data

## Flow Control Shape
We have to use flow control otherwise, each branch will process with inputted data, to actully work it like a condition, we need to use flow control as well


## Route
When you actually want to route to different process, then you use Route

## Branch Shape
Lets say you want to branch process to different branches such as Alaska, newyork, 
Now here you want to use route, since you are not using data, rather you will use branch shape

Branch shape will process all the data in each branch, unless end shape is used
otherwise we have to enable continue processing other branch in end shape
